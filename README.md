In this seminar paper, we try to study the effect of microfinance on economic development using the regulation on Indian microfinance institutions taken in 2011 as an exogenous shock. Microfinance is given to the financially excluded groups, especially the poor, mainly for productive activities. This helps in employment generation and poverty alleviation. Using difference-in-difference, we first would like to establish the effect of regulation on microfinance institutions. We find that following the regulation, the size of institutions, the business outreach and the profitability of the institutions have been affected negatively with statistical significance. We then further analyze the effect of regulation on the state-level economic development. Due to the insignificant results, we cannot conclude on the causal effect of microfinance on economic development. However, with better data and identification strategy, there is scope to explore this area.
